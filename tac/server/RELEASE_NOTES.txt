TAC SCM server release notes for version 0.8.19
4 September 2008

This is the server that ran the 2008 competition, with one small
exception: the code that generated the "adjusted ranking" is missing, because
it was a last-minute hack that is not worthy of release at this point.

There are no known high-priority issues with the server, except for an
unconfirmed suspicion that the supplier price computation is not exactly
as specified in the official game description.

There are a few suggested enhancements that are not included in this release,
including:
- generation of the "adjusted ranking" for tournament results, using the
  paired-sample t-test.
- Update to the server-agent protocol to allow agents to inform the server
  when they have finished sending their daily messages. This would be a
  benefit for local experimentation, because it would allow fast agents to
  complete games in significantly less than 55 minutes. It would also allow
  experiments with slow agents, including agents with human controllers.
- Separation of viewer load from agent interaction, using some sort of
  proxy server. This has been suggested repeatedly as a way to improve server
  performance in tournament play, but there is little evidence that viewer
  load has a material effect on server latency as seen by agents. The ability
  to offset the daily start times of multiple servers has significantly evened
  out the network load for the hosting site, and reduced the need for a viewer
  proxy function.
- A richer visual interface for viewers, along the lines of the CMU 
  log-analysis tool.
